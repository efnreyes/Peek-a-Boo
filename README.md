UIScrollView
============

The UIScrollView class provides support for displaying content that is larger than the size of the application’s window. It enables users to scroll within that content by making swiping gestures, and to zoom in and back from portions of the content by making pinching gestures. Read more in the Apple docs.

As a user, I want to add a user to Peek-a-Boo
3 points

    The information should include a photo, a primary telephone number, a primary address, and a primary email address
    You can add an image to your simulator by dragging the image on to your simulator, long-pressing on the photo when it comes up in Safari and then saving it to your photo library


Stretches
=========


As a user, I would like to put my contacts into groups (i.e. family, coworkers, friends)
3 points
As a user, I would like to see groups in the grid view mode in such a way that it is obvious that it’s a group of users
2 points


As a user, I want to see all of my contacts on one map
3 points


As a user, I want to search for a user based on any criterion
2 points


As a user, I want to send mail to a user based on their email address or call them based on their phone number
2 points

    This only needs to initiate the action as the simulator will not allow this to happen
    If it works correctly, the email will not send and the phone call will pop up an alert
